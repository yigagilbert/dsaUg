title: "About DSA Uganda"
---


The idea for starting Data Science Africa (DSA) was conceived by a group of data scientists working both in and outside of Africa in 2014 and it officially started with a week-long Data Science Africa event (Data Science Summer School and Workshop) at Nyeri, Kenya 2015. Since then, DSA has held 7 physical events in 6 African countries (including Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana) and one virtual event. These events have registered a participation of over 1400 from over 30 African countries.

In Uganda, DSA organised one physical event in 2016 and one virtual event in 2020. Approximately, a total of 120 Ugandan have benefited from these events. DSA aims at growing a pool of data scientists, Machine learning, AI expertise and related skills.  

Data Science Africa Uganda Chapter will replicate DSA at region/local chapters in Uganda- grow a pool of Ugandans with data science and related skills/qualifications. 
This comes at the right timing as NDPIII 2020/2021-2025/2026 has concretely identified  these skills and qualifications as gaps  required to achieve Ugandaâ€™s National development.  DSA Uganda chapter will be instrumental in contributing to the NDP III target of creating 520,000 jobs created annually. The target will be you.  

Our activities will include but not be limited to:
* Training and capacity building programmes
* Mentorships
* Grant (local data science project support), Fellowships/internships/research visits
* Local events +workshops + summer school (data schools)
* Career Guidance in schools (Compressive education program)
